2. GAME PLAY:
Jump into the water and avoid the bugs!
- Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move. That's easy!
- You can "warp" from one side to the other on the grassy area! That's good!
- You cannot "warp" on the stone block areas. That's bad.
- Everytime you make it to the water you will get 100 points! That's good!
- Everytime you and a bug cross paths, you lose a life. That's bad.
- For every 1000 points you earn you get an extra life! That's good!
- The more points you earn, the faster the bugs get! That...challenges you...so...that's good!

Enjoy!
